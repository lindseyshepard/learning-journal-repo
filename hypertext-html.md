# What do you remember about HTML?

<p> Doctype html5, different types of tags, images, title, main<br>
just all sorts of tags.
</p>

<p>What is nesting?
<li>lists?</li>

</p>
semantic tags are tags with a purpose that the browser and the human can read <br>
I realized I didn't actually need to create a different paragraph nultiple times, I can<br> 
just throw in the break tag.. whoops!<br>
</p>
<p>
something tells me there is a better way to do this. Maybe in the css set the width of the paragraph so the content is presented clean no matter the device the user is on

When you design a site you should keep in mind your audience. How will they be interacting with the site. What is the purpose, how is the user experience? Does it make sense? How user friendly?

What information are the users looking for, how often will they come to this page? 

When you know what the user will be doing on your site then you can split your site up into sections or pages. This will improve the flow of the page and the user experience while using your page. To help with this site maps and/or wireframes can be used. 

I think headers, footers, sectioning elements, classes and navigation play a key role in designing web pages. The header is what they see first, footer is great for consistency across pages when siting sources and good navigation around the content will be at the core of a good user experience.


On Extra Markup:

- Different versions of HTML and how to indicate which version you are using 
(The wonderful world of Doctype html)

- Adding comments to your code <!-- comment -->
- Global attributes such as class and ID 
- Elements used to group parts of the page
- Embed a page within a page using iframes
- adding info to the page using meta element 
- adding other characters like angle brackets and copyright symbols
