# Read
Document in your journal the different classifications of text editors, and why itâ€™s important for software developers to be thoughtful about their selection of what they use to write code.

What is the difference between a text editor and an IDE?
As stated from [this link](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf) a text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer. It allows you to write and manage text through your web browser. IDE is an Integrated Dev Environment. This is like a text editor but with more bells and whisltes.
_Code Completion_ was a noted feature of any text editing software. This is what I know as intellisense. At the end of the day most IDE's and text editors are equal but it depends on the user what application you want to use. Personally I lean toward using Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code (an IDE because it's everything in one).
I think it is important for developers to understand why they use what because it can be used differently. A Text editor seems more straight to the point and the source. You want to edit your html, you're right in the file to do so. An IDE gives you more feautures to play around with like syntax highlighting, or debugging. Depending on your needs, the complexity of the project and your skills level you can efficiently use tedt editors vs IDE's.

## Paths are a big deal

An absolute or relative path depending on it we refer to a _file_ or a _directory_
> Tip: file system under linux is a hierarchical structure. At the very top of the structure is what's called the root directory. It is denoted by a single slash ( / ). It has subdirectories, they have subdirectories and so on. Files may reside in any of these directories.

Relative path | Absolute path
------------- | --------------
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system. | A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
