# Git in a nutshell
> Git is Distributed Version Control System. Git stores data in a file system made up of snapshots, local operations, tracking changes, loss of data and states (committed and modified). Git goes back to open source software project Linux Kernel in 2002-2005. Since its inception in 2005 Git has become one of the world's most utilized Version Control Systems. Woot, Go Git!
