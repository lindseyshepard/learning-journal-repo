# What have you learned so far?

I have always wondered how some GitHub Accounts looked amazing in the readme and I can finally use markup to really make mine stand out just as much. Being able to make charts, bold or create inline text adds so much depth to the page and it can be used to really influence user experience. 
Git was also something great to touch on because I was somewhat familiar but I never was confident with the commands and what they all did. Today's lesson (3/17/2020) was perfect in filling in the blanks for me and understanding how the version control system works. I made notes of some simple commands that I can reference in the future.
