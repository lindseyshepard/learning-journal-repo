# JavaScript!

_I did my first **Do Along** with JavaScript! The main focus of this was the script tag. This is where the browser will render the javascript used in the project._

After creating the add-content.js file and add-content.html I was able to follow the steps to put this web page together. My first try did not work because I forgot I needed to link the .js file in the link href tag. Once I started typing the file name in, intellisens kicked in and my html was linked to my css.


Determining placement of the script tag has good and bad pratcices in .js. We went through three different locations to place a script tag during the **Do Along** challenge.
- The first challenge was to make it work in the head element. This is not the best practice because of how long it will take the browser to load the page for bigger projects. 
- Second challenge was to link the script tag in the body element but in the middle. Rending it before the paragraph tag. This is okay but still the web page will stop loading everything and focus on the script. 
- The last challenge was to render the script tag at the bottom on the body which is also best pratcice if the designer wants to keep in mind loading the site from the browser. In today's lesson I learned that the best pratcice would be to load the script tag at the botton on the body element.
