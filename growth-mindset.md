### Explain “growth mindset” in your own words
_Growth Mindset to me is being ready to not know everything but being prepared and **willing** to learn._

### Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a `growth mindset`
- I remind myself that I am new to this and learning for a reason. Everyone starts at the beginning and that's okay
- I keep in mind how far I have come and cut myself slack for not having an engineering background
- I'm not afraid to ask questions and I know being able to talk to other will get me through the challenges I face because I am not alone
