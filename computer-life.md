# How Computers Work

Designed to take input, store, output and process data. These are the 4 things that make a computer a computer. Computer started out as calculators and they would take hours to do basic math. Now we use them for memes.

**input**
> Keyboard, mouse, microphone, camera ..etc

**Storage and Porcessing**
> All the different types of inputs give the computer information which is processed (by algorithms which is a series of commands) then stored in memory.

**Output**
> This is what the computer returns to the user. This could be on a screen, it could be through sound or it could be sending data somewhere else in the world. The output from one computer is the input for another.


# Binary and Data

The electrical wires and circuts handing all the data within a computer. In binary this would be on or off, 1 or 0. This is also known as a bit. 8 bits and you have a byte. This makes up data.

Number Systems:
- Decimal
- Hexadecimal
- Binary

# Tell me about the Circuts and Logic

Circuits are what can modify and process the information that is represented in ones and zeros. it is the circuits of a computer that take in these electrical pulses and forms the output we are looking for. There are two different types of circuits **or** and **and** depending on what is going in and coming out

example:
> if you push a 1 into the curcuit and a 0 comes out, this will be considered **OR** because it is either a 1 OR 0. However if you push 1 and 0 into a circuit, if both signals are 1 then 1 would come out otherwise it is 0 and this is considered **and**
There is also an ADDER and these help with adding much larger numbers.

# CPU, Memory, Input & Output

CPU is the processing unit of the computer. 
Memory is the storage of the computer and that could be RAM which is temporary or hard memory and it will be stored. Input is given to the computer through peripheral devices like the keyboard, touch screen, mouse pad and you get the gist. Output as mentioned earlier is what the computer comes up with and gives back to you!

# hardware and the Software

My personal favorite is the hardware vs the software. Hardware is what you can see and touch but it is the software that controls the hardware. They interact with eachother using the CPU. 

Fun Fact:
> Software used to be written in binary! Imagine doing that now...

Then there is the operating system. This is the master mind behind the computer. It tells the computer how to use the software to run the machine. The operating system is what determines what the CPU will run too. 

_There you have it. A simple run down of how computer work and there is still so much out there_
