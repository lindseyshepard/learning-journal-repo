# Programming

To be a good programmer you need to know how to think like one. How can you design aplications to perform a certain way and achieve what youwant them too. You do this by writing steps. From steps to code is how you will be able to create functioning applications.

> Step 1: Create a Flow-Chart

 I reccomend drawing out what you are thinking. Get all the ideas on paper - never just jump into the code. Be an architect of your work. 
 From the flow chart you can write out what each step will be clearly, and double check so you don't skip over anything. After the steps are understood then you need to use the correct vocabulary and syntax so the computer understands what you are programming. 

Flow-chart Key |  (with steps)
---------------- | --------------  
GenericStep | Event  
Input or output | Decision  

_Summary_

A: What is a script and how do I create one?
- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. 
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically. 
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help)

# Expressons

An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value. There are two types of expressions.

1. Expressions that just assign a value to a variable
> var cat = "oreo";


2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value
> var x = 7 * 7;


# Operators

Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programming to create a single value from one or more values

## **Arithmetic Operators** 

Operator | Symbol 
--------- | -----------
Addition | +  
Subtraction | -  
Division | /  
Multiplication | *  
Increment | ++  
Decrement | --  
Modulus | %  


There is just one string operator: the + symbol. It is used to join (concatenate) strings on either side of the string.
Because of being able to concatencate a string it opens up what you can do with the string.
> 'Hell0' + 'World' = ' Hello World '

# FuNcTiOnS are fun!

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. Functions if written properly can be reused and save a lot of space in memory. 

Basic Function

Declaring a Function
> To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces. This is know as **function declaration**

Calling a Function 
> Having declared the function, you can then execute all of the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code. This is known as **calling the function**

Declaring Functions that need Information
> Sometimes a function need specific information for it to perform its task. In such cases when you declare the function you give it **parameters**. Inide the function these parameters will act like variables.

Calling Functions that need Information
> When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or as variables.

Getting a Single Value out of a Function
> Some functions return information to the code that called them. For example, when they perform a calculation, they return the result.
