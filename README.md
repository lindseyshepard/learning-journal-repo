# Learning Journal


### _About Me_
Hey I'm Lindsey! 27. I just moved to Washington in late December. I spent 4 years in the USMC in Communications. I found the MSSA program July 2019 and that was my first introduction to software. This course was my saving grace because I am still very new to the industry but I absouletly love what I am doing and learning so far. I work at my dream job already and I am in class to become the best developer I can be while I am in my learning phase.

### Explain “growth mindset” in your own words
_Growth Mindset to me is being ready to not know everything but being prepared and **willing** to learn._

### Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a `growth mindset`
- I remind myself that I am new to this and learning for a reason. Everyone starts at the beginning and that's okay
- I keep in mind how far I have come and cut myself slack for not having an engineering background
- I'm not afraid to ask questions and I know being able to talk to other will get me through the challenges I face because I am not alone
